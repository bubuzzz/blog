I started to use `vim` in the early stage of my programming life. During the 1st year in university, I used it as the main text editor to take note because I used Linux significantly [during that time](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-learn-to-use-Linux-Where-do-I-begin/answer/Thai-Tran-9?srid=iAWQ); therefore, vim is just like the first option there for editing file. That was the fun time since I could do what the heck I like (no client/manager/teammates have the ability to ask me: man, you have to use this "abc", since we are using this/ since we are coding this language so this "abc" is a good choice). Things started to change when I worked the real world, almost all the companies have the rules across the team and I don't have the right to choose the one for my job anymore.

After a while going up and down, I decided to go back to the origin, since I am sick of switching between window, terminal, leaving my hand out of the keyboard to reach to the mouse.... I spent the last 3 weeks to get used to vim again with all the plugins and MAN !! IT WAS SO FUN. During the work, when stucking with editing operations, I tried to search for the VIM plugins to fix the issues and finally, I have my own [configuration](https://github.com/bubuzzz/my-vim) on Github. The only problem I have now is because I open multiple files with VIM in different tabs, panes, I have to switch between those to manually `:wq` all the files (as in, now save all and close all options). I will try to figure out this when having time.

I also use `tmux` for splitting pane on the terminal, though not really much, since I have `iterm2` on my macbook which does the same job. Most of the time I used `tmux` is on server, when I want to `ssh` to the server, start the server and detach the tmux session and continue to code/split pane in the other sesssion

Overrall, it is always great to have somethings you love from the early stage of your life, isn't it ?
