## And the nightmare is comming

Recently, I started to lose my focus in the work. I sat there, started to write some line of codes, it did not run, I pissed off, I re-wrote those codes, it did not run neither. What happens with me ?

I started to learn coding when I was 15 years old. It was fun. It was really, really fun. I used to sit all days in front of the computer, tried to figure out how to make thing work. I got many job offered from many good companies back in my countries. I started to work professionally even I was a student. Even when I stayed at home for 1 or 2 years, I was still happy and did not need to worry about the living cost, because it was really easy for me to find remote job / project and have fun after the work. I have full time job, I also have part time job, I even have a startup with friends.

**Things has changed. There are several problems I see during a software developer 's life flow**

 - For me, coding is a habit, not a job. Back to my early days, I can work all days and nights with the habit, but when comming to the job, especially under some constraints for the particular tasks or with some ridiculous requirement from clients/companies, things become boring and plainly frustrated. When you have to work under those situations, obviously you don't want to think. This leads to the second points below.

 - I don't feel happy when I solved a problem. There is no feeling at all !!! It is just a thing that I have to do and I can do it. For the tough ones, I don't even have enough passion / patience to work on it anymore.

 - This becomes worse when I worked for too many projects at the same time. One project has one frustration, 3 projects will triple the stress, leading to there is not time to enjoy during the day.

 - Hacking is fun. Breaking the rules is fun. Sitting in one place from time to time, reading the required features, replying email to client, denying funny features, dealing with ridiculous requirements are not fun. Creativity only comes when I really enjoy the work, not from the frustration. The good part of programming is when you see your creativity appears, not when your 9-5 job completes


## What should I do now?

I have been dealing with this situation for a long time. Whenever I feel bored, I started to learn something else. A quick search from google also lead to the same [result](https://medium.com/@karolisram/preventing-burnout-for-programmers-12b4968adbaa#.f2pb10ya1) - along with sports, reading, sex (0_0) ... I still love programming, and I know that I will love it for the rest of my life, but at this moment, I knew that I cannot deal with it.

**Several thing that I should try**

 - Working on algorithm. My initial interest about programming is about using computer to solve problem, a.k.a, algorithm. It is logically to go back to the first place and start to love it again.

 - Write side small projects. Making thing completed will help I guess. Try to complete anything, regardless of programming or not.

 - Stop taking more projects. Happiness might come with money, but will not come along with frustration.

 - Write blog more often. I don't have a lot of people to talk with, thus talking to myself is ok !!!!
